## Chart No.1 - Cut Diamond Proportions

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut,fill = color)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ede0d4","#e6ccb2","#ffcdb2","#ffb4a2","#e5989b","#b5838d","#6d6875")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs (
    title = "Cut Diamond Proportions",
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Count",
    subtitle = "We found Cut Diamond Proportions",
    caption = "datasource: diamonds"
  ) 
```

----

## Chart No. 2 - Relationship between carat and price

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(500), 
       aes (carat,price, col = cut)) +
  geom_point(size=5, alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs (
    tittle = "Relationship between carat and price",
    x = "Carat",
    y = "Price USD",
    subtitle = "We found a posiive relationship between two variables.",
    captiom = "datasource: diamonds"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 4)
```

----

## Chart No. 3 - Relationship between carat and price by color
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(46)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(500)
       , aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(col = "#ef476f", fill = "#fcd5ce") +
  facet_wrap(~color, ncol= 4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between carat and price by color",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price USD",
    subtitle = "We found a posiive relationship between two variables.",
    caption = "datasource: diamonds"
  ) +
   scale_color_brewer(type = "div", palette = 5)
```

----

## Chart No. 4 - Compare clarity group by price
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(46)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(500), aes(clarity,price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "salmon") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Compare clarity group by price",
       x = "Clarity",
       y = "Price USD",
    subtitle = "We found SI1 clarity has the highest median than other clarity",
    caption = "datasource: diamonds"
  ) 
```

Note:

- SI1 clarity has the highest median than other clarity
- IF clarity has somewhat less variability
- Every clarity has an outlier except I1.

----

## Chart No. 5 - Most clarity of each cut
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
    count(clarity, cut) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(cut, clarity, fill = n)) +
    geom_tile() +
   labs(
    title = "Most clarity of each cut",
       x = "Cut",
       y = "Clarity",
    subtitle = "Ideal cut have VS2 clarity at the most",
    caption = "datasource: diamonds",
    fill = "count") +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "#f4acb7")
```
